# Instructions for reproducing results
an executable must be generated using the compiler g++: `$ g++ -o main problem7.cpp`. This will generate an executable "main", which will be executed `$ ./main`. The python script must now be
executed: `$ python3 problem7_plot.py`. Results should now be reproduced.
