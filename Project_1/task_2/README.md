# Instructions for reproducing results
Results may be reproduced by creating an executable using g++: `$g++ -o main problem2.cpp`.
"main" is now generated, and must be run using `$./main > data.txt`. The python script will then be executed using `$ python3 plotting.py`, and the results should now be reproduced.
